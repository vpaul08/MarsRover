# MarsRover
## Objective
Solution to MarsRover problem implemented using java as part of a technical *assignment/interview*

## How to run
To run this program in eclipse open AppRunner.java and then run it.

If you'd like to supply command line arguments to it, goto Run > Run Configurations. Then open the Arguments tab and provide the file name that contains the input data.

If no argument is supplied, the sample input data file will be parsed and processed for a sample run.

In order to run it completely independent of eclipse, you have to package it as a JAR with all the dependencies i.e. Java 6 and JUnit 4.

## Tests
In order to run the unit tests in eclipse, right-click the Project in the Package explorer and goto Run As > JUnit Test.
