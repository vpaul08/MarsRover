It seems that there's some problem with the format of the input file. Your input data file should be of the following format. 

Here the first line should be the top-right coordinates of the plateau. 
Next line onwards it should alternate between Rover initialization and movement instructions.
You can add as many rovers with their movement instructions. 
However, there should be no empty lines between the instructions.
